                  <p>Iâ€™m a front-end developer located in Zimbabwe i have a serious passion for UI effect. 
                      My interest in web developement started in 2022 when i joined uncommon.org.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As a web developer, I embarked on an enriching journey during my one-year experience as 
                    a student at Uncommon.org. This organization provided me with invaluable opportunities to 
                    delve into technology education and gain practical employment skills.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    During my time at Uncommon.org, I actively participated in their Technology Bootcamp, which 
                    catered specifically to unemployed young adults from low-income communities. This immersive 
                    program allowed me to take crash courses in design, coding, and marketing, equipping me with a 
                    solid foundation in these fields. I was able to explore various aspects of web development and 
                    discover my passion for creating innovative digital solutions.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    One of the highlights of my experience was the chance to work in the Innovation Hubs established 
                    by Uncommon.org. These sustainable workspaces served as a hub for our free education programs. Being i
                    mmersed in such an environment fostered creativity and collaboration, enabling me to apply my newly acquired 
                    skills to real-world projects.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In addition to my own learning, I had the privilege of giving back to the community through volunteer work. 
                    As a Bootcamp student, I dedicated my time to teaching free coding lessons to local primary and secondary 
                    students. Witnessing their enthusiasm and growth was incredibly rewarding, and it reinforced my belief in 
                    the transformative power of technology education.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Throughout my journey at Uncommon.org, I had the opportunity to work closely with industry professionals 
                    who served as mentors. Their guidance and expertise helped shape my understanding of web development and 
                    further fueled my motivation to excel in this field. I am grateful for their mentorship and the invaluable 
                    lessons I learned from them.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As a web developer, I honed my skills in front-end and a little of back-end development during my time at Uncommon.org. 
                    I became proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and gained hands-on experience with frameworks such as React.js and Node.js. 
                    I also developed a solid understanding of database management, utilizing tools.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My experience at Uncommon.org has not only equipped me with technical skills but also instilled in me a deep sense of purpose. 
                    I am passionate about leveraging technology to empower individuals and bridge the gap in access to quality education and employment 
                    opportunities. I am excited to continue my journey as a web developer, utilizing my skills and experiences to create meaningful and 
                    impactful digital solutions.
